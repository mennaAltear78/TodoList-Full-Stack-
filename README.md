# üìù ToDo List - Full-Stack Application

Welcome to my full-stack **ToDo app**! This project is a modern task manager built with **Next.js (App Router)** and **TypeScript**, using **Prisma with MongoDB** for data storage, **Clerk** for user authentication, **Zod** for form validation, and **shadcn/ui with Tailwind CSS** for a clean, responsive interface. I‚Äôve added **React Query** for client-side caching to make task loading fast and smooth.

I built this to experiment with a robust Next.js stack, focusing on **type safety**, **secure authentication**, and a **great user experience**. Whether you‚Äôre a developer looking to learn or just want a solid ToDo app template, this repo has you covered!
