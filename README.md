ToDo List - Full-Stack App
A modern, full-stack ToDo application built with Next.js (App Router) and TypeScript. This app lets users create, read, update, and delete tasks with full CRUD functionality, secured by Clerk authentication. Each userâ€™s tasks are isolated and stored in MongoDB, with data validation handled by Zod and client-side caching via React Query for a smooth, performant experience. The UI is powered by shadcn/ui and styled with Tailwind CSS for a clean, responsive design.
I built this project to explore a robust Next.js stack with Prisma and MongoDB, focusing on type safety, secure authentication, and a polished user experience. Itâ€™s a great starting point for anyone looking to build a full-stack app with these technologies.
Features

User Authentication: Secure sign-up, sign-in, and session management with Clerk.
CRUD Operations: Create, read, update, and delete tasks, with each userâ€™s tasks isolated.
Type-Safe Data: Prisma ORM for MongoDB interactions and Zod for form validation.
Performant Data Fetching: Client-side caching with React Query for fast task loading.
Responsive UI: Built with shadcn/ui and Tailwind CSS for a clean, mobile-friendly interface.
Server Actions: Next.js server actions handle CRUD operations securely.
MongoDB Backend: Tasks stored in MongoDB with a replica set for production-ready transactions.

Tech Stack

Frontend: Next.js 15 (App Router), React, TypeScript, shadcn/ui, Tailwind CSS
Backend: Next.js API routes, Prisma ORM, MongoDB
Authentication: Clerk
Data Validation: Zod
Data Fetching: React Query
Deployment: Ready for Vercel

Getting Started
Prerequisites

Node.js 18.17 or later
MongoDB instance (e.g., MongoDB Atlas with a replica set)
Clerk account for authentication
pnpm (or npm/yarn) as the package manager

Installation

Clone the Repository:



 tip   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/todolist-fullstack.git   cd todolist-fullstack

2. **Install Dependencies**:
```bash
pnpm install


Set Up Environment Variables:Create a .env file in the root directory and add the following:
DATABASE_URL="mongodb://<username>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<database>?retryWrites=true&w=majority"
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY="pk_..."
CLERK_SECRET_KEY="sk_..."
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL="/sign-in"
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL="/sign-up"
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_FALLBACK_URL="/"
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_FALLBACK_URL="/"


Get your MongoDB connection string from MongoDB Atlas (ensure it includes replica set parameters).
Get Clerk keys from Clerk Dashboard.


Set Up Prisma:Initialize Prisma and sync the database schema:
npx prisma generate
npx prisma db push


Run the Development Server:
pnpm dev

Open http://localhost:3000 to view the app.


Deployment

Push to GitHub:
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push origin main


Deploy to Vercel:

Link your GitHub repo to Vercel.
Add the .env variables to Vercelâ€™s environment variables in the project settings.
Deploy using:vercel --prod
